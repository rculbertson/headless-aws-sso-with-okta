## Install

### Linux / MacOS

```bash
curl -sL "https://github.com/rculbertson/headless-aws-sso-with-okta/releases/download/0.1.2/headless-aws-sso-with-okta_.0.1.2_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp/
sudo mv /tmp/headless-aws-sso-with-okta /usr/local/bin
```

### Windows

Download latest Windows binary from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/rculbertson/headless-aws-sso-with-okta/releases) and unzip to location in PATH

### From Source

```bash
go install github.com/rculbertson/headless-aws-sso-with-okta@latest
```

## Usage

The first run requires you to authenticate using either a push notification or Okta FastPass. Subsequent runs will authenticate using a saved cookie, making them much faster.

### Authenticate with email and a push notification (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

Okta Verify and FastPass do not have linux support. You must specify your email address and authenticate with a push notification.

```bash
aws sso login --no-browser | ./headless-aws-sso-with-okta --email <EMAIL> --okta-auth push-notification
```

### Authenticate with Okta Verify and FastPass (MacOS, Windows)

Uses FastPass's authentication method, e.g. your fingerprint.

```bash
aws sso login --no-browser | ./headless-aws-sso-with-okta --okta-auth fastpass
```

### Authenticate with Okta Verify and a push notification (MacOS, Windows)

```bash
aws sso login --no-browser | ./headless-aws-sso-with-okta --okta-auth push-notification
```
